# Real-Time-Interactive-Earthquake-Map
Description of this software:

--Developed a real-time interactive earthquake map that read live data from U.S.Geological Survey to plot markers in the locations where earthquakes of magnitude 2.5 or higher have occurred in the last week.

--The Processing Java Library is implemented as Graphical User Interface to achieve interactive technical features on the window supported by a Class PApplet.

--Cities under threat circle of nearby earthquakes are displayed on the map when clicking on earthquakes; Colors and radius of earthquakes markers are customized with respect to magnitude, depth, and geological environment of earthquakes. 

--Threat of earthquakes with depth between 0km-700km are evaluated to 177 countries with 40 major cities on the Interactive Earthquake Map.
